# Tools

This is a list of fun and useful tools I use! Feel free to give them a try.

## Browser Extensions

- [**1Password**](https://1password.com/)
  - Password manager. It's modern, secure, and I finally made the switch from Lastpass at the end of 2022, when there was [yet another security incident](https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident). 
- [**Auto HD for YouTube**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/auto-hd4k8k-for-youtube-y/fjdmkanbdloodhegphphhklnjfngoffa)
  - Forces YouTube videos to open by default at the quality that you specify. Removes a small bit of friction.
- [**Awardwallet**](https://awardwallet.com/)
  - This is the tool I use to manage things like air miles from multiple sources in one place.
- [**Bypass Paywalls Clean**](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean)
  - You can bypass paywalls to read news sites for free without logging in.
- [**Cookie Remover**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-remover/kcgpggonjhmeaejebeoeomdlohicfhce)
  - Useful, one-click solution for removing cookies from a website. (Occasionally helpful in conjunction with the Bypass Paywalls extension; try clearing cookies and refreshing the page if it doesn't work.)
- [**Copyfish**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/copyfish-%F0%9F%90%9F-free-ocr-soft/eenjdnjldapjajjofmldgmkjaienebbj)
  - OCR software. Useful for quickly extracting text from non-text sources (e.g. images, videos, PDFs) without needing to manually re-type it.
- [**Don't F\*\*\* With Paste**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dont-f-with-paste/nkgllhigpcljnhoakjkgaieabnkmgdkb)
  - Some websites "helpfully" block you from being able to copy or paste data into e.g. forms. This lets you get around it.
- [**Flying Blue: Shop & Earn Miles**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/flying-blue-%E2%80%93-shop-earn-m/dkmpgahpjfoicikbpmhmcichhedeaofk)
  - (Flying Blue is the alliance of KLM & Air France.) On some sites, you can get points for things you'd buy anyway by logging in via Flying Blue. I often forget which sites, thereby leaving free points on the table. This extension pops up a reminder on those sites, solving this.
- [**Honey**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/honey-automatic-coupons-r/bmnlcjabgnpnenekpadlanbbkooimhnj)
  - Tries coupon codes for you automatically. Only works occasionally, but for a few seconds of waiting, it's usually worth trying.  
- [**I Still Don't Care About Cookies**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/i-still-dont-care-about-c/edibdbjcniadpccecjdfdjjppcpchdlm)
  - Auto-accepts (the minimum required) cookies for you so you don't have to click endlessly on every damn website you visit. I know I shouldn't use this, but the browsing experience has become so tedious that I've borderline stopped caring.
- [**Keepa**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/keepa-amazon-price-tracke/neebplgakaahbhdphmkckjjcegoiijjo)
  - Adds price history charts and the option to be alerted on price drops to all supported Amazon sites. Good for checking historical data to see what a product has been priced at over time. 
- [**LingQ**](https://www.lingq.com/?referral=harryjramsay)
  - Browser extension for LingQ, a much more effective language learning tool than e.g. Duolingo. Saves text in your target language, which you can read via LingQ, add translations, check words, listen to how it sounds, and build up vocabulary plus listening/reading skills over time.
- [**Readwise Highlighter**](https://readwise.io/i/harry89)
  - Best read-it-later app I've ever used. This saves articles with a single click so I can check it out / highlight / take notes on it later.
- [**RescueTime**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rescuetime-for-chrome-and/bdakmnplckeopfghnlpocafcepegjeap)
  - Browser extension which helps me keep track of what I've been doing so I can get a better picture of how I'm spending my time.
- [**Screenshot Capture**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/screenshot-capture/giabbpobpebjfegnpcclkocepcgockkc)
  - Normally, I'd use `Cmd + Ctrl + Shift + 4` (on a Mac) to click and drag an area and save the screenshot of that area to my clipboard for pasting elsewhere. I use this 99% of the time. However, some sites like Udemy have implemented screenshot-blocking technology, which is incredibly unhelpful when halfway through a course and trying to take notes (all screenshots render as black screens). This usually allows me to bypass that problem.
- [**Toggl Track: Productivity & Time Tracker**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/toggl-track-productivity/oejgccbfbmkkpaidnkphaiaecficdnfn)
  - Easy, free 1-click way to track your time so you can see what you've been working on. I find it super helpful.
- [**Transpose: Pitch / Speed / Loop controls for transcribing music**](https://transpose.video/)
  - Amazing free extension that works on YouTube and Spotify and lets you manipulate audio for practising music. You can change the speed (helpful for transcribing), shift the pitch (good if e.g. a band is tuned down and you want to play along) and loop sections (great for isolating difficult passages and working on those, especially in conjunction with the speed adjuster).
- [**Unhook**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid)
  - Removes distractions from YouTube to make it less invasive. You can specify what you want to turn on or off (e.g. Shorts, sidebars, comments, even the homepage)
- [**Video Speed Controller**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk)
  - Can't live without this. I never watch videos at fixed speeds any more - I manipulate the speed for precisely what I need in the moment. `D` increments the speed by 0.1, and `S` decrements it. `Z` skips backwards 10 seconds; `X` forwards 10 seconds. `R` resets all changes back to default in one press. I use this to scan through less useful parts of videos and then slow down again when I need to pay attention. If I can't use this, I now feel like I'm missing a limb.
- [**Wayback Machine**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak)
  - Super useful for "link rot" e.g. a web page has been moved or deleted. If it's been archived by the Wayback Machine, you can usually pull up the most recent saved version. 
- [**uBlock Origin**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
  - Efficient, effective ad blocker that you can enable or disable quickly. It also has two features which are highly underrated: you can block specific page elements either temporarily for that session until you reload the page (the lightning bolt icon) or permanently for all sessions (the dropper icon). I "deleted" the Twitter "Trending" sidebar so I never have to see it again, but you can block e.g. an invasive page element whilst you're on a page, which is nice.
